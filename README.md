# Homeless-Shelter-Assignment-System
Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) and Safe Parking LA (SPLA) are two organizations in Los Angeles that service the homeless community. LAHSA provides beds in shelters and SPLA manages spaces in parking lots for people living in their cars. People in need of housing can apply for a space with either service. This project is aimed at SPLA choosing applicants that meet the SPLA specific requirements for the space and that also optimize the use of the parking lot for the week.

Place the input test cases one by one in an input file named "input.txt" in the same folder as Code.py to generate the output in the file "output.txt"
